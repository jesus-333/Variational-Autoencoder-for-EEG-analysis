# OLD BRANCH
This branch contain the repo before a complete rewriting of the code. The code has several last-minute additions to perform some tests. For a cleaner and more polished version look at the main branch. 

The main purpose of the repo is to have a backup copy that would show the code at the time the paper vEEGNet: A New Deep Learning Model to Classify and Generate EEG (ICT4AWE 2023) was written.

# Variational Autoencoder for EEG analysis
Variational Autoencoder for EEG analysis

##

Because of the tests mentioned above vEEGNet1 and vEEGNet2 are obtained from the same class by commenting different parts of the code.
- Copy all the contents of vEEGNet1.txt inside the vEEGNet.py file (overwriting the original contents) to get the code for vEEGNet1.
- Copy all the contents of vEEGNet2.txt inside the vEEGNet.py file (overwriting the original contents) to get the code for vEEGNet2.
The contents of the 2 files are very similar, with the only differences being the commented parts of the code I mentioned earlier
