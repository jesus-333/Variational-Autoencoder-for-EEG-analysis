# OLD BRANCH
This branch contain the repo before a complete rewriting of the code. The code has several last-minute additions to perform some tests. For a cleaner and more polished version look at the main branch. 

The main purpose of the repo is to have a backup copy that would show the code at the time the paper vEEGNet: A New Deep Learning Model to Classify and Generate EEG (ICT4AWE 2023) was written.
